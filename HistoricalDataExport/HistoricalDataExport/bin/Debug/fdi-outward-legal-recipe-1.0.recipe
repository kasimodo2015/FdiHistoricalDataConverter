In recent years, with the sustained expansion of foreign contracted service in China, the multiplication of labor service to foreign contracted projects played an active role for guaranteeing the due completion of related projects and promoting the developing this service. Meanwhile, however, the imperfect administration of some foreign contracted projects triggered annually escalation of disputes in foreign contracted projects, sit-ins and demonstrations by overseas labor service personnel in contravention of local laws, even massive and malicious conflicts with local police. The above-mentioned accidents not only hindered the operation of foreign contracted project, but blemished the whole image of Chinese enterprises, even exerted side effect upon the bilateral trade and diplomatic relations.&lt;span class=&quot;br&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The following are the reasons for the frequent occurrence of labor dispute: first, some enterprises went against the provisions for labor service to foreign contracted projects when sending contract workers abroad, failed to put into practice the standardized management in the process of recruiting, sending and administrating contracted workers, giving excessive priority to the process of sending while ignoring the relevant administration; second, foreign contracted units contracted or subcontracted the labor service to even enterprises without any operation qualification, which resulted in difficulties and even failure to confirm and fulfill managerial responsibility; third, some avaricious enterprises sought interest by improper means such as reducing labor service cost, deduction and arrearage  of wages, maliciously infringing the lawful rights of contract workers; fourth, the imperfection of the prevention administrative measures and systems resulted in insufficient fulfillment and undue treatment of labor disputes; five, some contracted workers, for their own interest,  intentionally provoked disputes, intensified conflicts which resulted in the escalation and deterioration of labor disputes.&lt;span class=&quot;br&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In order to strengthen the administration of labor service to foreign contracted projects, further perfect the related systems,  guarantee the lawful rights and interests of personnel sent abroad to the foreign contracted project, promote the sound and orderly development of foreign contracted enterprises, the Ministry of Commerce, in accordance with the related administrative measures on foreign labor cooperation, hereby formulated, printed and distributed to you Interim Measures for Labor Service Foreign Contracted Projects (hereinafter referred to as Measures).
